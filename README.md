# lvim

this is a folder for me to records my lvim's config. Only a small part of the changes.

# Bye, lvim

I have tried to modify my lvim, but I find thatlvim is too highly closed. Many times I try to modify it according my habit, but i can't! Maybe I should have used lvim before starting using the highly customized neovim.
